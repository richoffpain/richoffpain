- 👋 Hi, I’m Claoudy aka @richoffpain
- 👀 I’m interested in software development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript ( I finish a previous
introduction to it however I want to enter deeply into more advanced subjects and take
the time to work on some projects before diving into ReactJs or Angular. 
After finishing Javascript I'll start to study Algorithm and Data structure
to level up my problem solving skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn and grow with the sector
and I appreciate every constructive feedback, tips
or any recommendation.
- 📫 Thank You
